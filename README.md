## 📖 Executive Summary

This project presents an **end-to-end Intelligent PCB Defect Inspection System** designed for **real-world manufacturing quality assurance**.

Unlike basic defect detection prototypes, this system functions as a **complete industrial AOI platform**, integrating:

- Computer Vision for precise PCB alignment & defect localization  
- Deep Learning for high-accuracy defect classification  
- Business Intelligence logic for repair costing, scrap decisions, and yield analysis  
- Persistent data storage for auditability and production monitoring  

The final solution is delivered as a **deployable Streamlit web application** suitable for factory-level QA workflows.
